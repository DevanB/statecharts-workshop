# Bug-free React Applications with Statecharts and Xstate

Statecharts are an accepted and compelling standard for modeling application logic and behavior in a deterministic manner. State machines and statecharts increase productivity while reducing bugs. In this workshop you'll learn about state machines and statecharts, and practical applications of them with React.

We will cover topics such as visualizing application logic, locating problematic edge cases, constructing features, and auto-generating tests.
